## Answer 1

- `wc -l hg38-gene-metadata-feature.tsv`
- There are 61633 lines

Exercise 1:  
`cut -f 7 hg38-gene-metadata-feature.tsv | sort | uniq -c`
There are 19618 protein coding genes. 
I want to look into lncRNAs because I do not know much about them but they seem to have 18804 genes, which is a lot.

Exercise 2
`cut -f 1 hg38-gene-metadata-go.tsv | sort | uniq -c | sort -n`
This gene: ENSG00000168036 has 273 go_ids. 
`grep "ENSG00000168036" hg38-gene-metadata-go.tsv | sort -k 3 `
This gene has so many unique and different functions with chromatin binding and regulation leading me to belive it could be linked to signaling pathways and stem cell differentiation. 

Exercise 3
`grep "IG_" gene.gtf | grep -v "pseudogene" | cut -f 1 | uniq -c` 
52 IG genes are present on chr2
  91 IG genes are present on chr14
  16 IG genes are present on chr15
   6 IG genes are present on chr16
   1 IG gene is present on chr21
  48 IG genes are present on chr22

`grep "IG_" gene.gtf | grep "pseudogene" | cut -f 1 | uniq -c` 
1 chr1
  45 chr2
   1 chr8
   5 chr9
   1 chr10
  84 chr14
   6 chr15
   8 chr16
   1 chr18
  48 chr22

Exercise 4
We cannot 'just' use grep pseudogene gene.gtf because when trying to find 'lines' where the key value pair is a pseudogene there will be heavy overlap between gene types that include the overlap pseudogene. This overlap pseudogene is a different biotype altogether. A better format would be an additional grep before filtering for the pseudogene. In our case we filtered for IG_ first. 

Exercise 5 
`cut -f 1,4-5,14 gene-tabs.gtf > gene-tabs.bed`
I ran this and it worked to both cut only the chromosome, start, stop, and gene_name, as well as renaming the file.
