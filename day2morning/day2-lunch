## Answer 1

- `wc -l hg38-gene-metadata-feature.tsv`
- There are 61633 lines

## Exercise 1:  
`cut -f 7 hg38-gene-metadata-feature.tsv | sort | uniq -c`
There are 19618 protein coding genes. 
I want to look into lncRNAs because I do not know much about them but they seem to have 18804 genes, which is a lot.

## Exercise 2: 
`cut -f 1 hg38-gene-metadata-go.tsv | sort | uniq -c | sort -n`
This gene: ENSG00000168036 has 273 go_ids. 
`grep "ENSG00000168036" hg38-gene-metadata-go.tsv | sort -k 3 `
This gene has so many unique and different functions with chromatin binding and regulation leading me to belive it could be linked to signaling pathways and stem cell differentiation.
