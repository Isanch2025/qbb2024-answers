1. Which feature appears to be under the highest level of purifying (negative) selection?
    The exons appear to be under the highest level of purifying selection. The enrichment of exons steadily decreases as MAF increases and the stronger decline in exon enrichment compared to introns, cCREs, and other features suggests that variants in exons are more likely to be subject to negative selection. This is likely due to the  changes in these regions disrupting gene function, leading to deleterious effects.

2. Why do you think most features start out more enriched at lower MAFs and become more depleted as the MAF increases? 
    - SNP enrichment generally decreases as MAF increases. This is because increasing MAF represents increasing variability of that SNP (more presence of the minor allele). Thus, if sequence specificity is needed (as in the case of exons), these regions are less tolerant of SNPs and are thus less enriched.

 3. Does the relative levels of enrichment/depletion of features with respect to each other make sense? Explain.
    Yes, the relative levels of enrichment and depletion make sense. Exons and cCREs, which are regulatory elements, show higher levels of enrichment at lower MAFs because mutations in these regions are more likely to be deleterious due to their direct impact on gene function or regulation. As a result, they are under stronger purifying selection. In contrast, introns and other less functionally constrained regions are under weaker selective pressure. These regions can tolerate more variation without significant functional consequences, which explains their relatively consistent levels of enrichment across MAFs.
